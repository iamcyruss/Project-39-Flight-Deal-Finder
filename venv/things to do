grab the prices and update the spreadsheet with those prices if those prices are less than what's in the spreadsheet
When a low price is found the spreadsheet will update and a sms will be send notifying me of the change and what
the new value is. That way you can let this run for a while to gather what really is the lowest price for these type of flights.

can also create something to compare the last price to see if it is within say 10% of the lowest price found.
this wont update the speadsheet but rather send just the sms
